# Camera Model and Pose Estimation

## Parametriztion

1. Why we use homogeneous coodinates?
    
    1. To capture the concept of **infinity**, with `z=0`. This is extremely useful when some tedious geometric calculate is involved.

    2. **Projective geometry** relies heavily on homogeneous coordinates as well. However, projective geometry doesn't presever lots of properties, such as length, angle and etc.
