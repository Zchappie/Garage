# Stereo Reconstruction

### Input: two image streams from a pair of RGB cameras
### Output: two grayscale streams of RGB images

# Structure of files
- CameraCalib folder holds the main cpp, the name may change in the future
- output folder has the camera data of the stereo set (.yaml), which are generated by "Kalibr"

## Finished:
- Camera undistortion
- data stored in output/camera data folder, two .ymal/.txt files
- Camera intrinsic matrix
- Extrinsic matrix
- the parts above is done by library "Kalibr"
- two grayscale streams of RGB images

## TODOs:
- Use pointer to speed up ("separate left/right eye")
- 12fps t0 30fps

## Requirements:
- 30fps
- two grayscale streams of RGB images

## Remarks on the results
1. Camera sensor is 1/2.5'' which is around 5.76mm * 4.29mm
2. pixel size is 0.009mm/pixel
3. Images size: 640 * 480
4. Calulated camera focal length is around 3.6mm
5. The calibration takes some time, the fps becomes around 12.5 from originally 30
