# Methods of Product Development

> Guidance for exam preparation.
> * Memorize all the terminologies (bold words/box paragraphs/fact sheets).
> * For non-calulational methods, memorize the steps, pros and cons, when and why to use them.
> * Around two big calculation questions, about 20 points in total. From chap requirements and chap solutions.
> * Only one answer is correct in multiple choice questions.
> * ~70 points for 60 mins. 15 terminology fillups + 20 direct calculation + 20 multiple choices + 15 calculation follow-ups.

## Introduction 3'

1. What is Product Development?
    
    * **Products**: designed artefacts by humans. 
    * MPD methods applicable to **all** products.
    * Design ends where making (in terms of production) starts.
    * A **design problem** is a design task with a more or less specified design goal.
    * A **solution** (to a design problem) or a **good design** is a design reaching its design goal.
    * The key challenges of designing are:
      * Understanding the problem
      * Asking the right questions
      * Providing answers
      * Finding a solution
2. Challenges in Product Development

   1. Market-related Challenges

        External influence, e.g Technology, Competition, Customers, Product, Politics, etc. All these can be **VUCA**.
        * Volatility = characterized by or subject to **rapid** or unexpected change.
        * Uncertainty = the state of being **not clearly** identified or defined.
        * Complexity = characterises the behavior of a system or model whose components interact in **multiple** ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.
        * Ambiguity = the quality of being open to **more than one interpretation**; inexactness
   2. Designer-related Challenges
        * Many dependencies, variants
        * Counter-intuitive dependencies, nonlinearities
        * Solution Spaces within a Large Design Space
   3. Design-related Challenges

        * Humans as individuals: how to generate good ideas, limited intellectual capacity
        * Humans in groups: team dynamics
        * Groups of groups
    4. Combined challenges
        
        * Uncertainty
        * The dilemma of product development
