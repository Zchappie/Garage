# Methods of Product Development

> Guidance for exam preparation.
> * Memorize all the terminologies (bold words/box paragraphs/fact sheets).
> * For non-calulational methods, memorize the steps, pros and cons, when and why to use them.
> * Around two big calculation questions, about 20 points in total. From chap requirements and chap solutions.
> * Only one answer is correct in multiple choice questions.
> * ~70 points for 60 mins. 15 terminology fillups + 20 direct calculation + 20 multiple choices + 15 calculation follow-ups.

## Introduction 3'

1. What is Product Development?
    
    * A **design** is a description of an artefact to be made.
    * **Products**: designed artefacts by humans. 
    * MPD methods applicable to **all** products.
    * Design ends where making (in terms of production) starts.
    * A **design problem** is a design task with a more or less specified design goal. A **solution** (to a design problem) or a **good design** is a design reaching its design goal. Problems and solutions have a dynamic relationship. As the **interpretation** of the problem may depend on the designer. The solution might be **difficult** to find or even lies outside the stated problem space making it impossible to identify. Or even more than one solution of different values.
    * The key challenges of designing are:
      * Understanding the problem
      * Asking the right questions
      * Providing answers
      * Finding a solution
2. Challenges in Product Development

   1. Market-related Challenges

        External influence, e.g Technology, Competition, Customers, Product, Politics, etc. All these factors can be **VUCA**.
        * Volatility = characterized by or subject to **rapid** or unexpected change.
        * Uncertainty = the state of being **not clearly** identified or defined.
        * Complexity = characterises the behavior of a system or model whose components interact in **multiple** ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.
        * Ambiguity = the quality of being open to **more than one interpretation**; inexactness
   2. Design-related Challenges
        * Many dependencies, variants
        * Counter-intuitive dependencies, nonlinearities
        * Solution Spaces within a Large Design Space
   3. Designer-related Challenges

        * Humans as individuals: how to generate good ideas, **limited intellectual capacity**, such as dealing with complexity, dynamic systems, extrapolation of non-linear correlations, etc.
        * Humans in groups: team dynamics (different personalities in a team). Team size: 4~8. If too small, the team will miss interdisciplinary and error detection ability; however, too large will lead to inefficiency. 
        * Groups of groups
    1. Combined challenges
        
        * Uncertainty: difficulty to satisfy requirements, conflicting requirements, etc.
        * The dilemma of product development: at the very beginning, usually little information is acquired, and lots of possibilities; however, in the end, fewer possibilities are available but come with abundant information. **The more you know, the less you can do.**
    
    How to overcome all those challenges? Use Models and methods.
3. III-designed Products
   
   Examples: USB, Mac type-c connector.
4. Keywords
   * A **model** is a simplified description of reality. Thus, it is a form of abstraction of reality. It helps to understand complexity and to deal with the limitations of the human mind.
   * **Method**: is a more detailed view which describes **how** to do something by action items. Operation-oriented.
   * **Procedure Model**: is a more global view which describes **what** to do by results. More result-oriented.
   * "Its color (variable) is gray (value)."
